# BS-eiis-S
Build Something (even if it sucks) Saturday

This project is partially inspired by the below quote, which I came across in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DayanaBreathe/status/1456733443816103943?s=20).
> “Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”
